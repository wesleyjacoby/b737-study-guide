			"summary_full": "• **Purpose** — Ice/rain protection is provided by thermal anti‑icing (bleed‑air TAI), electrical anti‑icing, and windshield wipers.\n• **Major Systems** — Flight Deck Window Heat; Windshield Wipers; Probe & Sensor Heat; Engine Anti‑Ice (cowl); Wing Anti‑Ice (inboard LE slats).\n• **Crew Effects** — Anti‑ice selections can change stall warning logic and minimum maneuver cues; FMC VREF is not auto‑adjusted by icing logic.\n• **Ground vs Flight** — Some systems use additional thrust/duct‑temperature logic on the ground that is **disabled in flight** (e.g., WAI valves).",
			"flashcards": [
				{
					"q": "Why does the system deliberately regulate #1/#2 window temperatures to a specific level rather than simply 'hot'?",
					"a": "To maintain structural strength and resist bird‑strike loads while preventing thermal damage; overheating risks delamination/crazing."
				},
				{
					"q": "What crew action mitigates the risk of scratched windshields when precipitation stops during taxi?",
					"a": "Move wipers to OFF on a dry windshield; rely on coatings/defog or a light spray if available before re‑engaging."
				},
				{
					"q": "If operating on standby power, what are the practical implications for air data in icing?",
					"a": "Reduced probe heating (often only captain’s pitot heated) increases risk of ice‑affected airspeed/alpha; cross‑check sources and consider icing procedures."
				},
				{
					"q": "How does ENG ANTI‑ICE affect performance planning?",
					"a": "Bleed demand reduces available thrust; anticipate longer takeoff/landing distance and consider impacts on climb/EGT margins."
				},
				{
					"q": "What does an amber TAI on the CDS indicate in the context of EAI?",
					"a": "A cowl valve/switch disagreement condition after a delay—confirm valve position and investigate system status."
				},
				{
					"q": "Why does WAI trip OFF at liftoff yet icing logic persists in flight?",
					"a": "Switch logic changes state with air/ground; flight envelope protection remains biased for icing to preserve stall margins."
				},
				{
					"q": "When WAI is ON in flight, what must the crew remember about VREF?",
					"a": "FMC‑displayed VREF is **not** automatically adjusted for icing; apply company procedures for approach speeds."
